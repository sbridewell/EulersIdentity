# The following user stories have been withdrawn from the backlog and will not be implemented.

This is usually because they are duplicates of another story, or have been refined into smaller user stories which have superseded them.

## 3 - Update the console application to use the Polynomial and Equation classes (refined into stories 3.1 through to 3.5)

- As a developer with an interest in maths
- I want a user interface that I can use to exercise the functionality of the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
- So that I can use it to manually test the functionality of these classes
- Acceptance criteria
  - 1
	- Given I have an application that uses the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
	- When I run the application
	- Then I can create instances of the PolynomialTerm class for each term in a polynomial expression
	- And I can create an instance of the Polynomial class with these terms
	- And I can create an instance of the Equation class with polynomial expressions on both sides
	- And I can edit the terms of the polynomial expressions on both sides of the equation
	- And I can perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the polynomial expressions
	- And I can simplify an equation by performing the same operation on both sides, for example
	  - 2x^2 + 3x + 4 = 5x + 6, subtract 5x from both sides to get 2x^2 - 2x + 4 = 6, then subtract 6 from both sides to get 2x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0
  - 2
	- Given I want to test the functionality of the Polynomial class
	- When I run the application
	- Then I can evaluate polynomial expressions for given values of `x`
  - 3
    - Given I have an application that uses the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
    - When I run the application
    - Then it will execute as a Windows Forms application

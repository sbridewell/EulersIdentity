# Solution Summary

## Overview
The `EulersIdentity` solution is a .NET 8-based project that provides functionality for working with mathematical concepts such as polynomial terms, polynomials, and equations. The solution is structured into multiple projects, including a WPF application for user interaction and associated unit test projects for ensuring code quality.

---

## Projects in the Solution

### 1. **EulersIdentity**
- **Purpose**: Core library containing the mathematical logic for polynomial terms, polynomials, and equations.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `PolynomialTerm`: Represents a single term in a polynomial.
  - `Polynomial`: Represents a polynomial consisting of multiple terms.
  - `Equation`: Represents a mathematical equation with polynomial expressions on both sides.

### 2. **EulersIdentity.WPF**
- **Purpose**: WPF application for interacting with the core library.
- **Current State**:
  - Implements the MVVM pattern.
  - Contains a `MainViewModel` that manages the state of the application.
  - Includes a `TabControl` with three tabs:
    - `PolynomialTerm`: For creating and evaluating polynomial terms.
    - `Polynomial`: For creating and evaluating polynomials.
    - `Equation`: For creating and manipulating equations.
  - Tabs currently contain no child controls; functionality will be added in future sprints.

### 3. **EulersIdentity.Test**
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for the core library.
- **Testing Framework**: XUnit with FluentAssertions.
- **Code Coverage**: At least 90% branch and line coverage for all logic-containing classes.

### 4. **EulersIdentity.WPF.Test**
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for the WPF application.
- **Current State**:
  - Tests the `MainViewModel` class.
  - Verifies that the `PropertyChanged` event is raised correctly when the user interacts with the application.
  - Ensures that the MVVM pattern is followed.

## Key Features Implemented
- **PolynomialTerm**:
  - Creation and evaluation of polynomial terms.
  - String representation in the format `cx^e`.
- **MVVM Pattern**:
  - Separation of concerns between the View, ViewModel, and Model.
  - `MainViewModel` manages the state of the `TabControl`.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive tests for `MainViewModel`.
  - Tests ensure that the `PropertyChanged` event is raised correctly.
  - Code coverage includes all logic-containing methods.

---

## Pending Work
- **Sprint 3**:
  - Implement functionality for creating and evaluating polynomial terms in the `PolynomialTerm` tab.
  - Add validation for user input (coefficient and exponent).
  - Display evaluation results in the UI.
- **Future Sprints**:
  - Implement functionality for polynomials and equations in their respective tabs.
  - Add end-to-end integration tests for the WPF application.

---

## Coding Standards and Testing Guidelines
- **Coding Standards**:
  - Follow Microsoft C# coding conventions.
  - Use British English spelling for names.
  - Ensure methods have a cyclomatic complexity ? 10 and ? 50 lines of code.
  - Ensure classes have ? 500 lines of code.
- **Testing Guidelines**:
  - Use XUnit and FluentAssertions.
  - Achieve at least 90% branch and line coverage.
  - Exclude model classes with no logic from coverage analysis.

## Build and Compilation
- **Build Status**: The solution builds successfully without warnings or errors.
- **Verification**: All changes are verified using `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` commands.

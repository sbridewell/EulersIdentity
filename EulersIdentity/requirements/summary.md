# Project Summary - Euler's Identity

## Overview
Euler's Identity is a mathematical expression that combines several fundamental constants and operations. This solution provides a .NET 8 implementation for working with polynomials and equations, including operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomial terms.

## Projects

### 1. EulersIdentity.ConsoleApp
- **Purpose**: A console application that serves as the entry point for the solution.
- **Main File**: `Program.cs`
- **Functionality**: Outputs a welcome message and demonstrates Euler's Identity.

### 2. EulersIdentity
- **Purpose**: Contains the core library for polynomial and equation operations.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `Polynomial`: Represents a polynomial and supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - `Equation`: Represents a mathematical equation with polynomial expressions on both sides.
  - `PolynomialTerm`: Represents a single term in a polynomial.
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `IPolynomial`: Defines the contract for polynomial operations.
  - `IEquation`: Defines the contract for equation operations.

### 3. EulersIdentity.Test
- **Purpose**: Contains unit tests for the core library.
- **Testing Frameworks**: XUnit for testing and FluentAssertions for assertions.
- **Key Test Classes**:
  - `PolynomialTest`: Tests the `Polynomial` class, including its `ToString` method and arithmetic operations.
  - `EquationTest`: Tests the `Equation` class.
  - `PolynomialTermTest`: Tests the `PolynomialTerm` class.

## Current State
- **Code Quality**: The solution adheres to Microsoft's C# coding conventions and includes XML documentation for all publicly visible entities.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests provide over 90% branch and line coverage.
  - Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
  - All tests pass successfully.
- **Build**: The solution builds successfully without any warnings or errors.

## Recent Updates
- Enhanced the `Polynomial.ToString` method to exclude terms with zero coefficients.
- Expanded unit tests for `Polynomial.ToString` to cover various scenarios, including empty polynomials, single terms, and mixed coefficients.
- Addressed floating-point equality warnings by introducing tolerance-based comparisons in relevant methods.

## Future Work
- Extend the console application to demonstrate more advanced polynomial and equation operations.
- Add support for parsing polynomials and equations from strings.
- Improve performance for large polynomials.

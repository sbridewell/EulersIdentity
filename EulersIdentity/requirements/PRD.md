# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project overview
- **Product name:** Euler's Identity
- **Author:** Simon Bridewell

# Problem statement

Euler's Identity states that multiplying `e` by the product of `i` and `pi` results in `-1`. I want to create a C# library that can help me to understand advanced maths concepts such as how to raise a number to the power of a non-integer and how to raise a number to the power of an imaginary number.

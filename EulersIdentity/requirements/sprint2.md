# User stories - sprint 2

## 3.1 - WPF application to demonstrate the functionality of the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes

- As the developer of the EulersIdentity solution
- I want to create a WPF application
- So that I can use it to manually test the functionality of the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
- Acceptance criteria
  - Given I have a WPF application
  - When I run the application
  - Then it will contain a TabControl with three tabs
	- The first tab will be for creating and evaluating PolynomialTerm instances
	- The second tab will be for creating and evaluating Polynomial instances
	- The third tab will be for creating and manipulating Equation instances
  - Then the tabs will contain no child controls at this stage, as these will be added in subsequent user stories.

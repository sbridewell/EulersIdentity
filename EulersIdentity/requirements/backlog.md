# Backlog - Euler's Identity

## 1 - Raise a real number to a non-integer real power

- As a developer with an interest in maths, I want to understand how to raise a real number to the power of a non-integer real number, so that I can take a step towards understandinig Euler's identity.
- Acceptance criteria
  - Given I have chosen a real number `x` and a non-integer real number `y`
  - When I raise `x` to the power of `y`
  - Then I will be able to explain how the result is calculated
  - Then I will have some code which demonstrates this calculation

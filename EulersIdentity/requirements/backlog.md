# Backlog - Euler's Identity

## 3 - Update the console application to use the Polynomial and Equation classes

- As a developer with an interest in maths
- I want the console application to use the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
- So that I can use it to manually test the functionality of these classes
- Acceptance criteria
  - 1
	- Given I have a console application that uses the PolynomialTerm, Polynomial and Equation classes
	- When I run the console application
	- Then I can create instances of the PolynomialTerm class for each term in a polynomial expression
	- And I can create an instance of the Polynomial class with these terms
	- And I can create an instance of the Equation class with polynomial expressions on both sides
	- And I can edit the terms of the polynomial expressions on both sides of the equation
  - 2
	- Given I want to test the functionality of the Polynomial class
	- When I run the console application
	- Then I can evaluate polynomial expressions for given values of `x`
